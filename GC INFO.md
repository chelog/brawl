## Info for Gamemode Competition hosters

Some hints on how to quickly setup gamemode for a **solo server setup**:

1. Drop `addons` and `gamemodes` folder into `garrysmod` folder
2. Gamemode ID is `brawl` (set up in `autoexec.cfg` by adding `gamemode brawl` line)
3. Subscribe server to [this collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=628802365) (`628802365`)
4. Set starting map to `ahl2_fishdock`
5. Launch server and play
6. If you feel you want to move to next mode use `brawl_vote` console command (only available to superadmins)

How to setup **one-server-many-gamemodes**:  
Do the things above except following:

1. Replace `config.lua` with the [following code](https://hastebin.com/neyulitanu.vbs)
2. Set gamemode's maps to `ahl2_fishdock`
3. Instead of subscribing to mentioned above collection add these addons to server workshop collection:
